# Integrating Foundation Models within Cognitive Architectures Perception and Planning in Dynamic and Unstructured Environments

This repository accompanies my Master's Thesis, which investigates the integration of **foundation models** within **cognitive robotic architectures**. The work focuses on enabling multimodal perception, symbolic representation, and task planning in dynamic and unstructured environments.  

The repository contains demonstration videos of the experiments conducted, showing the performance of the proposed architecture across different scenarios.
